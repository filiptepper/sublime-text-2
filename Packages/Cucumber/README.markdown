I am hosting it at https://github.com/drewda/cucumber-sublime2-bundle for those who use Sublime Package Control.

The Table Cleaner plug-in has been kindly contributed by [@mishu91](https://github.com/mishu91). If you'd like just the plug-in, without the rest of this Cucumber bundle, see his repository at https://github.com/mishu91/Sublime-Text-2-Table-Cleaner
